# Go-gRPC-Methods
Basic Go gRPC Server and Client
___
We have implemented a simple gRPC server and client with the following functionality:

- simple RPC
- server-side streaming RPC
- client-side streaming RPC
- bidirectional streaming RPC
___
# How to use
there are 4 different functions in client/main.go

each function stands for one the methods

1- uncomment each function that you want to use and comment the rest

2- open two different terminal, use one for opening this client folder `cd client`

3- and the other one for server folder `cd server`

4- run `go run *.go` in both terminal, dont forget that you have to run your server first.
